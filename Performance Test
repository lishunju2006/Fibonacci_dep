When test cases are executed, these metrics should be monitored:

In the server side:
  * Disk utilization
  * CPU utilization
  * Network utilization
  * Memory utilization
  
In the client side:
  * Response time
  * Success/Fail rate
  * QPS
  * Throughput

In the client side, below metrics are also need to be monitored, in case
bottleneck comes from client side.
  * Disk utilization
  * CPU utilization
  * Network utilization
  * Memory utilization
  

Test scenarios:
  * Test different percentage of N with various ranges. From 0% to 100%; from
  Single range to multiple ranges.
  * Increase the total request numbers, from small to big.

Compare performance with different Cache_limit.
Compare performance with different hardware configurations.
