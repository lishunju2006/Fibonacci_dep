Two parameter are provided:
  * com.emc.interview.fibonacci.CACHE_LIMIT is for cache limit of fibonacci 
  list. First N numbers will be calculated and saved in memory.
  * com.emc.interview.servlet.MAXIMUM_N is the upper limit for "n" parameter. 
  N is invalid, when N is bigger than MAXIMUM_N.

As "n" becomes bigger, the job becomes I/O bound and CPU bound(Beyond 
CACHE_LIMIT).With my personal computer, the time cost and the response data
size are below. When n become bigger, CPU and network will becomes the 
bottleneck.

n=1000;  timecost=10;   size=103K
n=5000;  timecost=1519; size=2.5M
n=10000; timecost=8893; size=10M

Two parameters can be optimized, based on customer behaviors. In the 
/tmp/fib-log.log, request-ip, n, response-time of requests are saved. In order
to understand requests better, Data mining can be done.
  * If the percentage of large n is not small, Nginx and sever clusters can be 
  established.
  * If the percentage of large n bigger than CACHE_LIMIT is not small, 
  CACHE_LIMIT can be increased. Otherwise, CACHE_LIMIT can be decreased.
  * If the volume of request is not much and n is large, CACHE_LIMIT and 
  MAXIMUM_N can be increased.
  * n is very very big. To avoid CPU bound, results can be saved into DISK and
  read from DISK, directly. 
  
Btw, all optimization are based on the server hardware configuration, including 
memory, CPU, Network .etc.
